		Eco-conscious and extraordinarily beautiful, the former surfing retreat of Nihi Sumba Island scores top billing on lists of the world's best beach resorts. It presides over a wild and pristine palm-fringed slice of coast on the remote island of Sumba in Indonesia, about a one-hour flight from Bali. It's a fitting location considering the resort's philosophy is "The Edge of Wildness." The resort nestles within a nature reserve, and more than 2.5 kilometers of white-sand beach beckons beneath the cliffs below, with fantastic surfing, fishing, and snorkeling. You won't find TVs here, just cool ocean breezes, island adventures, warm and friendly staff, and glorious sea views. <br>

The 33 air-conditioned villas perfectly capture the essence of this tropical hideaway; with soaring thatched ceilings that peek out among the palms and sweeping ocean views. Configurations range from one to five bedrooms, and they come with features like large living rooms, private plunge pools, outdoor showers, and impeccable butler service. Families can reserve a delightfully quirky three-story treehouse.

If you can tear yourself away from the villa and beach, with its fantastic surfing, diving, and fishing, you can go horseback riding on the beach (the resort has an equestrian center), sign up for visits to nearby villages, explore hidden waterfalls, mountain bike, take a Land Rover safari, tour a chocolate factory, or relax at the beach club and pool. For the ultimate in pampering, you can embark on a day-long Spa Safari with multiple treatments and healthy meals. Free daily yoga in a sea-view pavilion is also offered. <br><br>
