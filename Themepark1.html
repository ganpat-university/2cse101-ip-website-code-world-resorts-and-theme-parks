Buena Vista Street feels as inviting as Disneyland’s Main Street USA, only the ersatz 1890’s midwestern vibe is replaced with cute approximations of Art Deco and Mission Revival Style. Elsewhere the park recreates a Victorian-era boardwalk, pays tribute to California’s national parks, and houses a tribute to the state’s aviation history in a fake aircraft hangar. There are also areas devoted to A Bug’s Life and Cars, and the latter’s cartoonish take on Route 66 is delightful.
