		If you're dreaming of a Tahitian tropical paradise with an eco-sensitive, low-impact approach, look no further than The Brando. Set on a pristine private island embracing a three-mile lagoon, this carbon-neutral resort is the ultimate in laid-back luxury. 
The resort was established by screen legend Marlon Brando to preserve the island's beauty and biodiversity and serve as a model of sustainability-solar power, seawater air-conditioning systems, and other renewable energy technologies power the entire island. Not surprisingly, nature lovers will be in heaven here. <br>

Set back from the beach, the thatched villas peek out unobtrusively from clusters of pandanus and palms. Modern furnishings and fixtures mix effortlessly with recycled and local building materials like thatch, stone, and wood. Features include private plunge pools, outdoor bathtubs, and media rooms with TV and Wi-Fi.
All the villas come with bicycles, so you can explore the island with pedal power.

As you would expect, activities revolve around the water, and the resort provides all the equipment you need to paddleboard, snorkel, dive, and kayak in the crystal-clear waters. If you'd like to learn more about the island's ecology and conservation, you can visit the eco-station and chat with the researchers. The resort also offers talks on Polynesian culture and history. Lagoon School keeps the little ones busy, and tennis, deep-sea fishing, dancing, and fitness classes are more active options. <br><br>
