		On a 6,000-acre private game reserve in Kenya near the border of Tanzania, Cottar's 1920s Safari Camp oozes Out of Africa elegance. The camp borders the wildlife-rich Serengeti National Park and Maasai Mara National Reserve, two of the best game reserves in Africa, and is one of only 10 accredited Global Ecosphere Retreats in the world, thanks to its commitment to sustainability and projects that help the local community.  <br>

Don't be put off by the word "camp." The luxury tents are a world away from those on your typical family camping trip, and the attentive staff make you feel like royalty. The expert Maasai guides and trackers are some of the best in the business, delivering you to classic African "big-five" wildlife action starring lions, leopards, rhinos, buffalo, and elephants.

	 The chef crafts culinary creations from fresh food grown right in the camp. Meals are usually served communal style in the huge dining tent or at breathtaking wilderness locations. In addition to the excellent game drives and walks, you can visit a Maasai village, swan around in the pool, or enjoy pampering spa treatments. Children of all ages are welcome.  <br><br>
