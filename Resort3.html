		One of the top safari lodges in South Africa, Royal Malewane in Thornybush Game Reserve bordering Kruger National Park, is for travelers who want to follow in the footsteps of the world's most discerning and wealthy wildlife lovers. Old-world colonial elegance sets the tone here, and animals take center stage - especially the relatively large number of resident lions. <br>

Eight impeccably decorated, air-conditioned suites recall the grand old days of Hemingway, with oriental rugs, antiques, thatched roofs, and four-poster beds draped in mosquito netting. Outdoor showers and plunge pools on expansive decks merge with the wilderness, where elephants and other wildlife are part of the views.

Daily activities revolve around the morning and evening game drives, when expert trackers and guides deliver you to National Geographic-worthy wildlife action. You can also relax at the award-winning bush spa and tone at the gym in your spare time. Children of all ages are welcome in the Royal Suites and Africa House, but they must be older than ten to stay in the luxury suites. <br><br>
