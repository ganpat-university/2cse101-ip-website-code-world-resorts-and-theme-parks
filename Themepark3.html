	<strong>Climb In, Sit Down, And Hold On</strong><br>
Prepare for a place where super heroes, beasts, and magical creatures stand before you. You're entering lands where everything is real. Explore a secret school of witchcraft and wizardry. Fly high above the city streets with a famous web slinger. Hide from hungry dinosaurs and hope you're not their next meal. And you can face the most colossal ape ever to walk the earth. Let the adventures begin.

Universal is known for some of the fastest, most-thrilling roller coasters in town, if not the country. The Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit  is the signature coaster at Universal Studios with a 17-story drop at an adrenaline-pumping 65 mph. To ease the pain, you can create your own playlist for the ride, if you can acutally hear it over your own screams.

		<p>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Diagon Alley is still nearly as busy as it was when it opened.Also inside Diagon Alley, Ollivanders wand shop is a popular attraction along with the new Hogwarts Express train which transports guests over to Hogsmeade.<br><br>
			The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and Transformers, two 3-D rides, are also very popular and notable for their cutting-edge technology. Because of the recent release of "Jurassic World," the new Raptor Encounter at Jurassic Park provides one thrilling photo op. Despicable Me Minion Mayhem and The Simpsons Ride are also fairly new additions. But don't let their theater settings fool youâ€”you're in for a wild and entertaining ride.
